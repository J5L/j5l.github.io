This is my "homepage". It aims to give you a short overview of my life and what I like to do. In the Blog section you will find various Projects, that I completed. Most of them are university projects. The others are a product of me trying to learn new techniques.
Recently (in February 2020) I finished the Bachelor Program in Statistics. You can view it here. Its about "Model-Free Implied Volatility".
